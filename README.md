This is a high level overview of a lot of greenhill's code

## file structure

files are broken into

- commons
	- contains various reusable non-sceen files (fonts etc.)

## Notes

When refering to an object's own content, please use ```self.```
Godot allows you to refer to an object's own content by just calling it like ```color``` instead of ```self.color```
